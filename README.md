## Sparkify: Data Modeling and ETL with Postgres and Python

Sparkify is a fictional music streaming app. They have stored all of their song and user activity data in JSON files and are looking for a way to effectively organize their data and surface it for analysis. This project seeks to do exactly that by programmatically extracting the data, processing it, and storing it in a PostgreSQL database for future analysis.
